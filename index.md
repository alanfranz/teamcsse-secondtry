What do you think about fresh BS graduates in the Computer Science and Software Engineering field?

Are they trained for doing their career? Should they? If they aren't, why, and what could and should be done?

Help us investigate those dynamics. You can read a bit more about [our research](/ourresearch/),
[about us](/about), discover how we [care about your privacy](/privacy/), or just [subscribe](/hearback/)
if you want to hear back from us when the research is over.

But, most important: please [fill out our survey!](/fill-survey), then [share our website](#sharediv) with
how many people you can! Coworkers, other professionals, teachers, students, we'd like to collect quite a lot
of data on the topic!
