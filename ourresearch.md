# What's the problem?

In the tech sector, something called **skill gap** exists. As Ray Dawson put it [back in 2000](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~mlancast/cs254/ppt/p209-dawson.pdf), _many employers find that graduates and sandwich students come
to them  poorly prepared for the every day problems encountered at the workplace._

Some approaches to make such gap smaller have even been attempted, but they're far from widespread.

# What are we trying to understand?

We don't think that universities are unable to teach and train students, or that students can't learn certain skills. We suspect, instead, that students, teachers, and professionals have different ideas and expectations of what higher education should be, and we want to find out.

Help us by **filling out our survey**, and please share it with as many people as you can!
