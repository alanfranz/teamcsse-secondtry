# What personal data am I giving away?

We're not asking about your name, e-mail, telephone number. If you want to get
the results, you may subscribe to our single-shot newsletter, but you may do
that even if you don't fill out our survey.

# How will you treat my answers?

Your data will be collected and analyzed on our systems, based on Google products
like Google Forms and Google spreadsheet, and both your aggregated data and your
raw data will be available for the general public. If, when collecting your data,
we feel that some information may give away a subject's identity (e.g. open-form
questions), we won't release that data to the general public, but such data may
still be available for inspection for Georgia Tech students and instructors, on
private systems.

# Notifications for results

We're using Mailchimp to handle our newsletter, in order to notify you when the
results are available. We'll delete the newsletter once we've sent the notifications.

# Cookies, analytics, etc.

We're using Google Analytics to keep track of how many users visit our website,
just to make a bit of connections between how many visits we receive and how
many surveys get filled out. We won't use Analytics to correlate who's visiting
the website and who took a survey in a certain instant.

The retention period for Google Analytics data is 14 months, the minimum amount
we could set it to.
